# Mario Kart Profiler

This is a fun little project that gives you a _super accurate_ description of what kind of person you are based on your favorite character to play Mario Kart and your favorite item to use while doing so.

## General info

The aim of this project was to make something fun that would let me practice using third party libraries and JSON. Before this, I had never used an external CSS library or a custom component library in my projects. It was challenging to incorporate something that didn't have a ton of documentation (like the numerous blogs one can find on Create React App), but I got it worked out. The CSS library is nes-css, which is built in to nes-react, which is what I used.

## Technologies

- Create React App - https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
- React - version 16.8.6
- react-dom - version 16.8.6
- react-scripts - version 3.0.1
- nes-react - version 1.0.2
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

## Status

Project is: _in progress_ <br>
I am working on making this more mobile-friendly.
